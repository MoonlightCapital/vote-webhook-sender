# Vote webhook converter

This is a node app that takes incoming webhooks from bot list websites, and sends them as a standardized JSON objet that is sent through a Discord webhook. Designed for use by [MoonlightBot](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC).

This is intended to be hosted on Glitch to pass votes to a bot without the need of having an actual web interface. It requires a Discord webhook and some environment variables to be set up.
